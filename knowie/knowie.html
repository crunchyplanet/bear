                    <p>Knowie is a crowdsourcing Q&A platform that enables people with experience and expertise in
                        different areas to answer each other's questions by directly communicating with each other.
                        Knowie comes in the form of a desktop device and a mobile app, allowing the user to seek
                        consultation and provide help at any time and place.</p>

                <div class="contentblocks" id="problemstatement1">
                    <p>The massiveness of online resources has made information acquisition really easy. There is a
                        variety of platforms that cater to our needs for knowledge, advice, and recommendations. The
                        search bar has become our best buddy when it comes to consultation and problem-solving.
                        Especially with crowdsourcing, we're able to reach out broadly and learn from other people's
                        experience and expertise.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="contentblocks" id="problemstatement2">
                    <p>However, the
                        large amount of information could sometimes be overwhelming. It is a hassle to sort through all
                        the sources and extract the most useful piece. Even with platforms dedicated to questions and
                        answers, sometimes you need some luck to get up-to-date solutions that apply to your particular
                        case without too much digging. How might we make the most of crowdsourcing and exchange
                        experience and expertise in an
                        efficient way? How might we reshape the experience of consulting the internet and make it feel
                        personal? </p>

                <div class="contentblocks" id="persona">
                    <p>I started by creating a persona for the user group and identifying the frustrations and needs of
                        the user.</p>

                <div class="contentblocks" id="platforms">
                    <p>Keeping the user's needs in mind, I researched some existing crowdsourcing Q&A platforms such as
                        Quora and Stackoverflow and studied their features. I was also referenced to an older search
                        service called Chacha, which provided answers to people's individual questions over text. The
                        research gave me a better idea of how to foster a knowledge exchange dynamic and what I should
                        focus on to keep the experience simple and rewarding.</p>

                <div class="contentblocks" id="brainstorm">
                    <p>Through brainstorming, I defined the important and features of the platform I'm designing. The
                        platform could be accessed from both a mobile app when you're on the go and from a destop device
                        when you're at home or in the office. Each question will be directed to a specific person who
                        has experience or expertise in the matter and provide helpful answers. The person who asks the
                        answer will be able to follow up more easily due to the conversational nature of this exchange.

                    <p>The platform would be a great place to seek help and advice for a broad range of issues.
                        Especially when the user needs some personalized consultation or when the user has a question
                        that's more specific and hard to find direct answer to on the internet. It's also good for
                        situations where the user only needs a quick answer but has a hard time digging through the
                        search result or finding the appropriate search term. An experienced person will be able to
                        provide a
                        quick pointer.

                    <p>After developing the initial concept, I continued to think about ways to make the personified
                        character(I named it Knowie, a know-it-all, but a helpful and approachable one) of the platform
                        smarter and spontaneous. The reason for there to be a representative
                        character is it will make the communication more natural and reassuring. Knowie will be the
                        bridge
                        between the questioner and the answerer. It will also provide suggestions and assistance along
                        the
                        side and make the user's experience more smooth. This would include helping clarify the
                        question, suggest possible questions that the user might have based on their interests and
                        recent activities. When a user receives an answer, Knowie could also help understand and
                        interpret it, and provide directions.
