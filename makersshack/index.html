            Maker's Shack is a material trading platform designed to
            <span class="hl"
              >help makers and creatives increase the utilization rate of
              materials and reduce waste</span

            <p class="subheading">Problem</p>
            <p>
              Makers and creatives often find themselves in the situation of
              accumulating different types of materials that they don't always
              end up using. It results in storage shortage and material waste.
              There's not yet a good solution for trading second-hand materials
              that makes it a convenient and repeatable process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="ps w45">
            <p class="subheading">Solution</p>
            <p>
              With a second-hand material trading platform, makers can get what
              they need at a low price and let go of what they don't. They can
              also keep an inventory of what they have at hand and manage their
              supply with ease. The additional social functions let users share
              their work and find inspiration.

        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            The user research for this project was done by our 3-person team. We
            investigated the material utilization, recycling, and reuse in the
            maker community, with the goal of identifying the problems and needs
            that makers have with materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, We interviewed some independent designers and makers
            in the bay area as well as directors of makerspaces to get a sense
            of how professional makers budget their material use and deal with
            waste. We based our interview on the following research questions
            and got some valuable insights from our interviewees.
          </p>
          <ul class="bulletpoints">
            <li>
              What factors influence makers' material choice for a project?
            </li>
            <li>
              Where do makers find their materials? How do they acquire them?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do makers plan their material use during the making process in
              order to reduce waste?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do makers deal with their leftover materials and unwanted
              projects?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there established ways that individuals and
              organizations(makerspaces) use in terms of waste reduction and
              material reuse?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks">
          <img class="images" src="assets/quotes.png" />
          <p class="captions">What our interviewees said</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            From our interviews, we learned that "hoarding" is a common practice
            for makers due to uncertain future needs and lower unit price. As a
            result, storage becomes a common problem because they wouldn't
            quickly get through what they have in storage while they accumulate
            other new materials. Some makers develop their own ways to make use
            of scrap and get the most out of their materials, others actively
            exchange extra material with peers or give away spare material on
            Craigslist. But in general, there's still a concern about
            <span class="hl"
              >how to keep a balance between having enough supplies and storage
              space, and how to discard no longer needed materials
              properly</span
            >. Based on the findings, we created two personas to illustrate the
            makers' needs and pain points regarding their material utilization,
            waste, and recycling.

            After the research project, I started thinking about a design
            solution that help makers deal with their spare materials and reduce
            waste. I wrote down some "how might we" questions to explore the
            possible directions.
          </p>
          <ul class="bulletpoints">
            <li>
              How might we help makers sort out their material storage and
              figure out what's not needed?
            </li>
            <li>How might we reduce material waste caused by overstocking?</li>
            <li>
              How might we build a platform for makers to share and exchange
              their spare materials?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we encourage makers to make use of other people's spare
              material instead of getting new supplies?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we cultivate a nourishing and inspiring culture in the
              maker community with the material-sharing practice?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With these questions in mind, I came up with some ideas for a
            platform with material logging, sharing and project browsing
            features.

            After consolidating my ideas, I decided that the app would need the following

            Post and browse second-hand material;<br />&emsp;&emsp;2) Communicate with other users to establish a transaction;<br />&emsp;&emsp;3) Establish
            a personal inventory system for better organization;<br />&emsp;&emsp;4)
            Share project ideas based on scavenged material.

            The user could freely browse available material offers in the shack
            and add preferences to filter results. On the detail page for each
            posting, the user could view images, description, and see reference
            products online. For additional information, the user could directly
            message the owner or post a public question so other people could
            also see.

            While messaging with the owner, people could ask about ways to

            To add a material listing, the user would upload a few images and fill in the information about the material. The user could either add the material to their inventory, as a way to
            document and sort their material storage, or mark the price,
            location, and handling method to post it to the platform. The user
            could check their inventory for the material they posted and
            received.
