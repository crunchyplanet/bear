          <p>
            For a generative UX research project, I, with two teammates,
            investigated the material utilization, recycling, and reuse in the
            maker community. Through qualitative research, we learned about the
            problems and needs that makers have with materials. After the the
            research project, I designed an app for makers to exchange unused
            materials based on the research findings.

        <h3 class="subtitles" id="research">RESEARCH</h3>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            We interviewed some independent designers and makers in the bay area
            as well as directors of makerspaces to get a sense of how
            professional makers budget their material use and deal with waste.
            We based our interview on the following research questions and got
            some valuable insights from our interviewees.
          </p>
          <ul class="listofq">
            <li>
              What factors influence makers' material choice for a project?
            </li>
            <li>
              Where do makers find their materials? How do they acquire them?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do makers plan their material use during the making process in
              order to reduce waste?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do makers deal with their leftover materials and unwanted
              projects?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are there established ways that individuals and
              organizations(makerspaces) use in terms of waste reduction and
              material reuse?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks">
          <img class="images" src="assets/quotes.png" />
          <p class="captions">What our interviewees said</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            From our interviews, we learned that hoarding is a common practice
            for makers due to uncertain future needs and lower unit price. As a
            result, storage becomes a common problem because they wouldn't
            quickly get through what they have in storage while they accumulate
            other new materials. Some makers develop their own ways to make use
            of scrap and get the most out of their materials, others actively
            exchange extra material with peers or give away spare material on
            Craigslist. But in general, there's still a concern about how to
            keep a balance between having enough supplies and storage space, and
            how to discard no longer needed materials properly. Based on the
            findings, we created two personas to illustrate the makers' needs
            and pain points concerning their material utilization, waste, and
            recycling.

          <p>
            After the research project, I started thinking about a design
            solution that help makers deal with their spare materials and reduce
            waste. I wrote down some "how might we" questions to explore the
            possible directions.
          </p>
          <ul class="listofq">
            <li>
              How might we help makers sort out their material storage and
              figure out what's not needed?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we reduce material waste caused by overstocking?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we build a platform for makers to share and exchange
              their spare materials?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we encourage makers to make use of other people's spare
              material instead of getting new supplies?
            </li>
            <li>
              How might we cultivate a nourishing and inspiring culture in the
              maker community with the material-sharing practice.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With these questions in mind, I came up with some ideas for a
            platform with material logging, sharing and project browsing
            features.

        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            Consolidating my ideas, I decided that the app would need three main
            features: 1) Post and browse second-hand material; 2) Establish a
            personal inventory system for better organization; 3) Share project
            ideas based on scavenged material. Since the transaction of
            materials on this platform depends on direct communication instead
            of an automated order system, the messaging function between users
            is also important.

            After arriving at a well-structured wireframe, I moved forward and
            filled it in with visual elements and content. I chose blue to be
            the main color of the app to provide a sense of reliability and
            organization.

            The user could freely browse available material offers in the shack
            and add preferences to filter results. On the detail page for each
            posting, the user could view images, description, and see reference
            products online. For additional information, the user could directly
            message the owner or post a public question so other people could
            also see.

            While messaging with the owner, people could ask about ways to
            utilize the material as well as discussing how they could hand off
            the material if they decide to take it.

            Adding a material listing is made easy for users. They could upload
            a few images and fill in the information about the material. The
            user could either add the material to their inventory, as a way to
            document and sort their material storage, or mark the price,
            location, and handling method to post it to the platform. The user
            could check their inventory for the material they posted and
            received.

            There's also a community gallery section for users to share the

            different materials could be utilized.
