                <p>Pixel band is a tool designed for hand therapy patients. Hand exercises are repetitive processes
                    which could sometimes be boring and tedious. Pixel band, which consists of a physical device and a
                    computer program, brings delight and playfulness into the experience by synchronizing the exercise
                    with the reveal of a funny meme.</p>

                    <p>After analysing the hand movement during the exercises. I decided to prototype a hand band that
                        covers across the metacarpophalangeal joints (the part where fingers start) and embed a flex
                        sensor in the band to mearsure the movement. I took the approximate numbers from the flex sensor
                        when the fingers are flexed and stretched out when someone is wearing the band and so the
                        program
                        would know when the user has reached various positions.

                <div class="contentblocks" id="code">
                    <p>I wrote a Processing program that pixelate a meme image to the extreme at the beginning and
                        increase the resolution gradually as the flex sensor data from the band comes in. There are
                        instructions on the screen telling the user what to do. Each time the user streches their
                        fingers, the block size on the screen reduces for three seconds, while the user hold their
                        finger position. Then the instruction tells the user to relax their fingers until the "stretch"
                        instruction shows up again. After repeating 10 times, which is the suggested amount for the
                        exercise, the resolution reaches its full and the text on the meme becomes legible.

                    <p>For example, there could be one image for each stretch to keep the user engaged.
                        The program could also have a feedback and achievement system to encourage the user to make it a
                        habit.</p>
