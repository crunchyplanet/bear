                    <p>Inspired by these projects, I started designing a
                        light box that responds to motion. I chose weather patterns to be the subject of the animation
                        because our familiarity with them would make
                        the light animation recognizable but refreshing to our senses. They also lend themselves to
                        having views from different perspectives, which would make the connection between the display
                        and people's motion very natural.</p>

                    <p>After some research on digital electronic devices, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi and connect a
                        32x32 LED matrix and a 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope to it. It was my first time using a
                        Raspberry Pi so it took me some effort to set it up. I started writing Processing sketches for
                        the weather animations and displayed the graphics on the LED matrix using the <a
                            href="https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix">LED-matrix
                            library</a> created by Henner Zeller. Then I used
                        the MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope to gather the orientation and rotation data. Integrating the
                        code for the animation and the measurement, I was able to associate the change of the animation
                        with the movement of the device.

                    <p>For each type of weather, there are three perspectives: sky view, side view, and ground view. As
                        I was writing the code, I looked up videos for references of different weather patterns in
                        motion. After a lot of tweaking and testing, I ended up with animations for rain, snow and
                        lightning.</p>

                    <p>While working on the animation on the screen, I was also thinking about the casing for the box
                        and the diffuser for the light. To keep it simple and clean, I built a wooden box to enclose all
                        the electronic parts and fit the LED panel in. Then I placed a piece of translucent acrylic on
                        top of the light to diffuse it. I tried different materials for the diffuser to achieve an ideal
                        effect. The acrylic is attached to the box with screws and nuts so that
                        the distance between the acrylic and the LED could be adjusted to achieve various degrees of
                        diffusion. Originally I was using buttons for switches for the different weather modes, but then
                        I decided to make all the controls completely motion-based, to achieve a more coherent
                        interaction experience.</p>
