            Wild Posts is a platform where people create mock social media posts
            on behalf of other species in nature, intended to help people take
            the perspective of nature and build a stronger empathy with other
            species. Aside from the posting platform, the application also
            provides a way to help users adopt more eco-friendly behaviors. This
            project was done as part of my MFA thesis,
            <i>Taking Nature's Perspective</i>.

            <p>
              As human-beings, we rarely think in the perspective of other
              species, and we don't always see ourselves as an integral part of
              the ecosystem, which makes us less involved in conserving our environment.<br />It's also hard to transform environmental awareness into behavioral changes and eco-friendly habits.
            </p></div>
            <div class="contentblocks ctext">
            <h4 class="subheading">&#128161; Solution</h4>
            <p>
              The social media platform allows users to learn about
              environmental problems in a light-hearted way. <br />
              And the mobile app helps users pick up positive behaviors as they
              become more informed and keeps them on track of their eco-friendly
              efforts.

          <p>
            My thesis explored how we as humans could develop a closer
            connection and stronger empathy with nature. I did some research in the context of
            environmental psychology to find out how
            people connect to nature and the factors that
            affect people’s eco-friendly behaviors.</p><p>
            I learned that <span class="hl">closer connection and stronger
            empathy with nature are associated with more
            environmentally responsible behaviors</span>. When
            people consider themselves to be an integral
            part of nature and care about other species’
            well-being, they tend to act in a more
            eco-friendly way.

            Through research, I also found perspective-taking to be an effective

              >recognize the sentience and subjectivity of other species</span
            >. As an experiment, I created a series of social media posts and
            conversations in the voices of non-human beings based on the
            problems they're facing under the environmental conditions.

            I found this process to be an educational and eye-opening
            experience, so I wanted to see what other people would feel about
            it. I asked people to come up with a post on a social platform of
            their choice based on something they read about the natural
            environment. I used a Google Form to collect responses and feedback
            on their experience. My test users said that the process of creating
            the post was amusing and it allowed them to learn something they
            weren't aware of before.

            Seeing the potential of this format in raising environmental
            awareness and cultivating empathy with nature, I created a test website using PHP and SQL. The platform allows users to compose
            posts with the content that they come up with. Aside from the main
            posts stream, a section for recommended articles was also included
            to potentially expand users' scope.

            As these posts help people learn about the environmental problems
            that are impacting other species, it's important to incorporate a
            <span class="hl">call to action</span> and guide people to adopt
            more eco-friendly habits.

            While the social posts serve as an entry point, the system expands to a
            feedback loop that engages the user on both an awareness level and a
            behavioral level, in which process users become more psychologically
            connected with the ecosystem.
