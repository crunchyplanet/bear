            Wild Posts is a platform where people create mock social media posts
            on behalf of other species in nature, intended to help people take
            the perspective of nature and build a stronger empathy with other
            species. I designed it as part of my master's thesis,
            <i>Taking Nature's Perspective</i>. Aside from the posting platform,
            the program also provides a way to help users adopt more
            eco-friendly behaviors.

            My thesis explored how we as humans could develop a closer
            connection and stronger empathy with nature, which are associated
            with more environmentally responsible behaviors.

            Through research, I found perspective-taking to be an effective
            approach that helps people recognize the sentience and subjectivity
            of other species. As an experiment, I created a series of social
            media posts and conversations in the voices of non-human beings
            based on the problems they're facing under the environmental
            conditions.

            I found this process to be an educational and eye-opening
            experience, so I wanted to see what other people would feel about
            it. I asked people to come up with a post on a social platform of
            their choice based on something they read about the natural
            environment. I used a Google Form to collect responses and feedback
            on their experience. My test users said that the process of creating
            the post was amusing and it allowed them to learn something they
            weren't aware of before.

            Seeing the potential of this format in raising environmental
            awareness and cultivating empathy with nature, I moved on to create
            a platform on the web to enable posting and hosting of these posts.

            I built a website with PHP and SQL that allows users to compose
            posts with the content that they come up with. I also included a
            section for recommended articles to expand the user's scope.

            As these posts help people learn about the environmental problems
            that are impacting other species, it's important to include a call
            to action and guide people to adopt more eco-friendly habits. Since
            behavior change requires long-term commitment to make a difference,
            I went on to design a mobile app that could keep track of and nudge
            people’s everyday behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on test users' feedback and some research about people's
            pro-environment habits, I came up with two personas that represent
            the users who would be using the app.

            psychologically connected with the ecosystem.

            improved by this mission, and sometimes a tip that would provide an
            idea on how to go about it, bringing the users a step further.
          </p>

            The missions are categorized by the environmental problems that

            The app helps users keep track of their progress and get a sense of
