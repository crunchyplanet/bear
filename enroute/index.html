            En Route is a tool that makes travel planning and route tracking
            easy and enjoyable. With maximum customizability, the user will be
            able to plan a route that covers any important spot they wish to
            visit, along with other activities that meet their interests. When
            the user is on their trip, the app will manage real-time updates
            according to where they are on their route, and provide handy tips
            and reminders along the way.

            <p class="subheading">Problem</p>
            <p>
              It takes a lot of time and effort to plan a trip that covers all
              your interests in a destination and match your travel style, time,
              and budget. It's also challenging to keep all the resources handy during the trip. Sometimes unexpected changes happen while
              you’re on the trip, and it’s not easy to make quick adjustments.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="ps w45">
            <p class="subheading">Solution</p>
            <p>
              En Route has a trip planning system that allows users to input their
              preferences and constraints, and help users
              build custom itineraries that meet their needs. <br />The
              live-tracking function makes it easy for users to stay informed
              and prepared for their upcoming destinations during the trip.

        <div class="contentblocks ctext" id="user">
          <p>
            Based on the problems defined in this project, I created a proto-persona and a
            journey map to identify target users' pain points and design opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The target user is travelers who want an easier way to make travel plans.
            <span class="hl"
              >They might have some interests and priorities in mind as well as
              some restrictions around time and budget.</span
            >
            And they want to make practical and informed travel plans and get
            the most out of their experience. During they trip, the would like to keep their itinerary handy and be able to make impromptu adjustments if needed.

            Through brainstorm, I came up with some features that would help the
            user make a plan without painstaking research and arrangement but
            still meet their interests and restrictions.
          </p>
          <ul class="bulletpoints">
            <li>Allow users to input their traveling preferences and limitations (style, pace, duration, budget, must-include destinations, etc.) in the planning interface.

              <li>Automatically generate a travel plan based on users’ input.
              </li>
              <li>Enable users to reorder stops in the trip plan and swap out unwanted destinations.

        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            To help users make <span class="hl">highly customizable plans</span> according to their
            preferences, the app needs a strong knowledge base and
            powerful algorithms. And the user interface for the trip planner needs to let users access the rich information intuitively.</p>
            <p>Once the traveler is on their way, they can launch the planned trip, and the app would serve as an
            informed travel guide that they can refer to for any information and resources. During this project, I focused on designing the experience of making travel plans and launching them for live-tracking.

        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            In the planning phase, the traveler's needs are broken down to
            different parameters, and the user could be as specific as they wish
            about their preferences. A suggested route will be generated based
            on the user's input. Each spot on the route can be edited so the user
            could explore different options.
          </p>

        <div class="contentblocks">

        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            In addition to the mobile app, I also designed a web version,
            which allows users to take advantage of the screen space and
            navigate more freely, especially in the planning phase.

            During the trip, the user can get information and tips about
            destinations. Some steps or destinations will also allow users to
            jump to other relevant apps like Uber, Airbnb, and Yelp for extended
            functions. If a change to the plan comes up, or an unexpected
            situation like a bad weather is detected, the app will offer
            suggestions to adjust the plan.

        <div class="contentblocks w30">
          <p>
            I created some animation to fill in the transition between the
            user's input and the system-generated route to give the user a
            better idea of what's been taken into consideration.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fullwidth"></div>
        <div class="contentblocks w30">
          <p>
            I also designed animation that displays when the user reload for a
            different result. Having the extra time between the input and output
            not only allows time for the algorithm to calculate in a technical
            sense, but also communicates to the user that the system is treating
            every demand carefully.
