                <p>En Route is a tool that makes travel planning and route tracking easy and enjoyable. With
                    maximum customizability, the user will be able to plan a route that covers any important
                    spot they wish to visit, along with other activities that satisfy their needs and desires. When
                    the user
                    is on their trip, the app will manage real-time updates according to where they are on their
                    route, and provide insider tips and reminders along the way.</p>

                        oppoturnity to develop a method for people to onboard a travel destination. Starting from there,
                        I brainstormed some ideas about what could help people have the experience they desire in their
                        travels in terms of planning and guiding.</p>

                <div class="contentblocks ctext" id="idea">
                    <p>I decided to build a tool that facilitates people to make highly customizable plans according to
                        their preferences and back it up with smart algorithms and a strong knowledge base. While people
                        are traveling, it would serve as an informed guide for the traveler to refer to.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>In the planning phase, the traveler's needs are broken down to different parameters, and the user
                        could be as specific as they wish about their preferences. A suggested route will be generated
                        based on their input. Each spot on the route is changeble individually so the user could explore
                        different options while keeping the spots that they like.</p>

                    <p>At this point, I got some feedback. It was suggested that there could be two touch points for
                        this tool - a web version that allows the user to give more input and view the wide range of
                        choices, and the mobile version optimized for quick planning and guide on-the-go.</p>
                    <p> People also
                        said that it would be convenient if the app could document the trip. Based on these feedback, I
                        iterated my idea and developed some prototypes.</p>

                <div class="contentblocks ctext" id="animation">
                    <p>I created some animation to fill in the transition between the user's input and the
                        system-generated route to give the user a better idea of what's been taken into consideration. I
                        also designed animation that displays when the user reload for a different result. Having the
                        extra time between the input and output not only allows time for the algorithm to calculate in a
                        technical sense, but also communicates to the user that the system is treating every demand
                        carefully.

                        of their
                        experience. Using the web platform for information-heavy scenarios and mobile version for
                        quick data

                        selecting, sliding bar, etc.) should match the type of information, helping the user to
                        understand the indication of their response and avoiding confusions.</p>
