            En Route is a tool that makes travel planning and route tracking
            easy and enjoyable. With maximum customizability, the user will be
            able to plan a route that covers any important spot they wish to
            visit, along with other activities that meet their interests. When
            the user is on their trip, the app will manage real-time updates
            according to where they are on their route, and provide insider tips
            and reminders along the way.

        <div class="contentblocks ctext" id="user">

            The target user is travelers who want an easier way to plan their
            own trips. They might have some interests and priorities in mind as
            well as some restrictions around time and budget. And they want to
            make practical and informed travel plans and get the most out of
            their experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on my idea of the target user, I created a proto-persona and a
            journey map to identify the pain points and design opportunities.

        <div class="contentblocks w40" id="brainstorm">
          <p>
            Through brainstorm, I came up with some features that would help the
            user make a plan without painstaking research and arrangement but
            still meet their interests and restrictions. To make the most of the
            plan, I also thought about how it will come into play during the
            trip and what would help with its flexibility.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks w40" id="brainstormpic">

        <h3 class="subtitles" id="prototype">SKETCH &amp; PROTOTYPE</h3>

        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            I decided to build a tool that facilitates people to make highly
            customizable plans according to their preferences, which is enabled
            by a strong knowledge base and algorithms. While people are
            traveling, it would serve as an informed guide for the traveler to
            refer to at any time. I focused on designing the experience of
            making the plan and following the route during the trip.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks">
          <img class="images" src="assets/structure.png" />
        </div>
        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            In the planning phase, the traveler's needs are broken down to
            different parameters, and the user could be as specific as they wish
            about their preferences. A suggested route will be generated based
            on their input. Each spot on the route can be edited so the user
            could explore different options while keeping the spots that they
            like.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the trip, the user can get information and tips about
            destinations. Some steps or destinations will also allow users to
            jump to other relevant apps like Uber, Airbnb, and Yelp for extented
            functions. If a change to the plan comes up, or an unexpected
            situation like a bad weather is detected, the app will offer
            suggestions to adjust the plan.
          </p>

        <div class="contentblocks" id="sketch">

        <div class="contentblocks ctext">
          <p>
            In addition to the mobile app, I also designed a web version mainly
            for the planning phase, so that the user could have more space to
            view the preference choices for the trip.

        <div class="contentblocks w30">
          <p>
            I created some animation to fill in the transition between the
            user's input and the system-generated route to give the user a
            better idea of what's been taken into consideration.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fullwidth"></div>
        <div class="contentblocks w30">
          <p>
            I also designed animation that displays when the user reload for a
            different result. Having the extra time between the input and output
            not only allows time for the algorithm to calculate in a technical
            sense, but also communicates to the user that the system is treating
            every demand carefully.

            &bull; Different touchpoints (devices) could be used to cater to the
            needs of the user in different phases of their experience. Using the
            web platform for information-heavy scenarios and mobile version for
            quick data retrival could make it more efficient and easier to
            maneuver for the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            &bull; When designing the user interface for collecting the user's
            input, the input method(typing, selecting, sliding bar, etc.) should
            match the type of information, helping the user to understand the
            indication of their response and avoiding confusions.
