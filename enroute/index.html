            En Route is a tool that makes travel planning and route tracking
            easy and enjoyable. With maximum customizability, the user will be
            able to plan a route that covers any important spot they wish to
            visit, along with other activities that meet their interests. When
            the user is on their trip, the app will manage real-time updates
            according to where they are on their route, and provide handy tips
            and reminders along the way.

            Based on the problems defined in this project, I created a proto-persona and a
            journey map to identify target users' pain points and design opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The target user is travelers who want an easier way to make travel plans.
            <span class="hl"
              >They might have some interests and priorities in mind as well as
              some restrictions around time and budget.</span
            >
            And they want to make practical and informed travel plans and get
            the most out of their experience. During their trip, they would like to keep their itinerary handy and be able to make impromptu adjustments if needed.

            Through brainstorm, I came up with some features that would help the
            user make a plan without painstaking research and arrangement but
            still meet their interests and restrictions.
          </p>
          <ul class="bulletpoints">
            <li>Allow users to input their traveling preferences and limitations (style, pace, duration, budget, must-include destinations, etc.) in the planning interface.

              <li>Automatically generate a travel plan based on users’ input.
              </li>
              <li>Enable users to reorder stops in the trip plan and swap out unwanted destinations.
              </li>

            To help users make <span class="hl">highly customizable plans</span> according to their
            preferences, the app needs a strong knowledge base and
            powerful algorithms. And the user interface for the trip planner needs to let the user navigate through a large amount of options and information in a intuitive way.</p>
            <p class="contentpiece w100">Once the traveler is on their way, they can launch the planned trip, and the app would serve as an
            informed travel guide that they can refer to for any information and resources. During this project, I focused on designing the experience of making travel plans and launching them for live-tracking.

            In the planning phase, the traveler's needs are broken down to
            different parameters, and the user could be as specific as they wish
            about their preferences. A suggested route will be generated based
            on the user's input. Each spot on the route can be edited so the user
            could explore different options.

            In addition to the mobile app, I also designed a web version,
            which allows users to take advantage of the screen space and
            navigate more freely, especially in the planning phase.

            During the trip, the user can get information and tips about
            destinations. Some steps or destinations will also allow users to
            jump to other relevant apps like Uber, Airbnb, and Yelp for extended
            functions. If a change to the plan comes up, or an unexpected
            situation like a bad weather is detected, the app will offer
            suggestions to adjust the plan.

            I created some animation to display while the system is generating a route based on the user input, which makes the transition less boring and gives the user a
            better idea of what's been taken into consideration.

        <div class="contentblock">

            <li>It’s important to strike the right balance between customizability and the amount of user input required.
